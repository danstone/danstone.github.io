# Functional Programming - A Beginners guide

## What is functional programming?

So what does it mean for code to be functional?

***The art of programming with pure functions that operate on data.***

## Why?

You will hear a lot about concurrency, making it easier by applying functional techniques or tools. This is a pleasant side effect of functional programming that is certainly encouraging its adoption.

A better reason would be that functional programming can be used to *reduce complexity* and write *simple* software. 

As I am a Clojure developer, I must quickly give the "clojure definition" of ***simple*** and ***complex***.

### Simple
- About one thing
- Performs one task
- Single responsibility

### Complex
- Interleaving of many different *things*
- Many responsibilities

For an excellent talk on simplicity, complexity and easiness see Rich Hickey's  [simple made easy](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy).
