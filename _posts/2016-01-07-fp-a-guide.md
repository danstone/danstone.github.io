# Functional Programming - A Beginners guide

## Why?
Programming is difficult. We tend to create a lot of complexity, and are being tasked with providing ever more sophisticated programs.

We here a lot about concurrency, making it *easy* by applying functional programming, I do not agree this is why we should be doing it. If anything I think the fact that concurrent functional systems are easier to build than imperative ones, simply arises from a set of tools that are valuable for entirely different reasons.

Functional programming to me is a great tool for *limiting complexity* and creating simple software.

As a Clojure developer, I use a very rigid definition of ***simple*** and ***complex***.

### Simple
- About one thing
- Performs one task
- Single responsibility

### Complex
- Interleaving of many different *things*
- Many responsibilities
- Performs many tasks likely because of interleaving
